    <h2>About DegreeMate</h2>
    <p>
      DegreeMate is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to support post-Junior College (JC) students in Singapore who are considering university education at Singapore Management University (SMU). Many students are uncertain about what degree to pursue. DegreeMate helps by leveraging their interests and suggesting suitable SMU degree programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students often come from a general academic structure focusing on subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, Humanities, and General Paper. Due to limited career-specific exposure and commercial experience, they may feel overwhelmed by the number of university options.
    </p>
    <p>
      DegreeMate provides personalized, accessible guidance to help students explore their post-JC academic options with clarity and confidence.
